    * Clean the code, remove alert(), translate error messages

 - Bugs to fix:
    * Fix the export to freemind template related functions
    * Fix space related stuff (buttons, flex...)
    * Make sure (" < > &) are replaced by XML equivalents (&lt &gt &...) in evaluations fields edited/imported by the editor (looks like it's good now, to be confirmed)
    * Fix "collapse all" button randomly not working and sometimes very slow (to be confirmed)
    * Fix selecting items in tree moving stuff the wrong way (xul bug ?)
    * Make sure that open, load, new evaluations keeps item order
    * Opening a file with spaces with the command line doesn't work
