TODO list:

 - Global changes:
    * Correctly include XSLT files in the extension
    * Improve QSOS 2.0 version support
    * Find a way to validate sheets before opening/saving them
    * Clean the code, remove alert(), translate error messages
    * Tell O3S who we are when we're uploading evaluations (require changes in O3S too)

 - Bugs to fix:
    * Fix space related stuff (buttons, flex...)
    * Make sure (" < > &) are replaced by XML equivalents (&lt &gt &...) in evaluations fields edited/imported by the editor (looks like it's good now, to be confirmed)
    * Fix "collapse all" button randomly not working and sometimes very slow (to be confirmed)
    * Fix selecting items in tree moving stuff the wrong way (xul bug ?)
    * Make sure that open, load, new evaluations keeps item order
    * Opening a file with spaces with the command line doesn't work

 - Translations:
    * Keep french and english translations updated and correct wrong phrasing
