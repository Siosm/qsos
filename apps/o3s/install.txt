Open Source Software Selection (O3S)
Installation instructions

* Prerequisites
** PHP5
** GD support (Debian: apt-get install php5-gd)
** XML support (needs DOMDocument class, php-xml package on Fedora)
** XSL in php (php5-xsl package on Debian)
** JpGraph2, for PNG graph generation
*** Note that the 2.x branch is needed (on my Debian/etch I had to download source code from JPGraph website: http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/jpdownload.php) 
*** You might have to do something like "ln -s /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype" to enable Mirosoft Arial font support

* Download o3s source code from QSOS CVS : cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/qsos co qsos/apps/o3s

* Modify config.php accordingly to comments included in the file itself

* Make sure the account running your webserver owner od the o3s folder (Debian: chown -R www-data:www-data o3s)

* The folder containing the QSOS evaluation ($sheet in config.php) must be organized in this way:
[Family F1]
  [Software F1S1]
    [evaluation F1S1 v1.3].qsos
    [evaluation F1S1 v2.4].qsos
  [Software F1S2]
    [evaluation F1S2 v1].qsos
[Family F2]
  [Software F2S2]
    [evaluation F2S2 v1].qsos
and so on...
