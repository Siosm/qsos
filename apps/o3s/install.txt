Open Source Software Selection (O3S)
Installation instructions

* Prerequisites
** git
** PHP5
** GD support (Debian: apt-get install php5-gd)
** XML support (needs DOMDocument class, php-xml package on Fedora)
** XSL in php (php5-xsl package on Debian)
** JpGraph2, for PNG graph generation
*** Note that the 2.x branch is needed (on my Debian/etch I had to download source code from JPGraph website: http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/jpdownload.php)
*** You might have to do something like "ln -s /usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/truetype" to enable Mirosoft Arial font support

* Download o3s source code from QSOS git: git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/qsos.git

* Modify config.php accordingly to comments included in the file itself

* Place a clone of the repository you want to push evaluations to in the o3s folder.

* Make sure the account running your webserver owns the o3s folder (Debian: chown -R www-data:www-data o3s)

* Make sure your webserver has password-less (ssh-key) commit access to the repository

* Uncomment the designated lines in upload.php

* The folder containing the QSOS evaluation must be organized in this way:
  - o3s_folder/qsos/repositories/incoming/[language]/evaluations/[type]/my_evaluation.qsos
  - o3s_folder/qsos/repositories/incoming/[language]/templates/my_template.[mm,qtpl] (mm for QSOS 2.0, qtpl for QSOS 1.6)
