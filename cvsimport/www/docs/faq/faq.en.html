<h1>What is the gain for myself if i use QSOS for my evaluation?</h1>
<p>
QSOS a lots of adventages. The major are certainly these ones:
<ul>
<li>a public point of view: Neutrality is for us a fondamental principe. In general it's hard to keep an objective point of view when we do an evalution. QSOS sheet are published at the very begining of there creation to get point of view from other people</li>
<li>gain of time: QSOS offerts a predesigned method with other adventages like Editors or XML standardised file</li>
<li>community contribution: Thanks to the growing community, the work you did today should be updated for the next update of the evaluated software</li>
<li>a updated repository: QSOS format use to have minor changes. This is natural since benchmark world is not static and evolves quickly. When a sheet is on the repository new entrys are added automaticly by a bot. The author just have to feed them</li>
