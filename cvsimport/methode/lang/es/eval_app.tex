\subsection{Evaluation sheet}
Every software release is described in an evaluation sheet. This document includes information more detailed 
than the identity card since it focuses on identifying, describing and analyzing in detail each 
evolution brought by the new release.
\subsubsection{Scoring}
Criteria are scored from 0 to 2. These scores will be used in Step 4 - "Select" 
to compare and select software according to the weightings, representing the user's requirements 
specified in Step 3 - "Qualify".

The following paragraphs describe the criteria used for each axis of evaluation
Note that the same criterion or similar criteria can appear on different axis.

\subsubsection{Functional coverage}
The functional grid to use is determined by the software's family and proceeds from the frame 
of reference of Step 1 - "Define".
Consult the site \url{http://www.qsos.org} for details of functional grids by software families.

For each element of the grid, the scoring rule is as follows:


\begin{figure}
\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline \TS{Functionality} & \TS{Score}\\
\hline Not covered & 0\\
\hline Partially covered & 1\\
\hline Completely covered & 2\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}


In certain cases it can be necessary to use several functional grids for a same software, 
for instance when it belongs to more than one software family. 
In this case, the functional criteria are distributed on separated axis in order to be 
able to distinctly evaluate the functional coverage for each family.



\subsubsection{Risks from user's perspective}

This axis of evaluation includes criteria to estimate risks incurred by the user when adopting a 
free or open soure software.
Scoring of criteria is done independently of any particular user's context 
(the context is considered later in Step 3 - "Qualify").


Criteria are split in five categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item Intrinsic durability
\item Industrialized solution
\item Integration
\item Technical adaptability
\item Strategy
\end{itemize}


The following tables detail each one of these categories, by specifying the rule of notation 
to be used for each criterion.

\subsubsection{Granularity of scores}
As stated above, it is possible to iterate the QSOS process. 
At the evaluation step this brings the capacity to score criteria in 
three passes with different levels of granularity:

\begin{itemize}
\item First the five main categories
\item Then the sub categories of each category
\item Finally every remaining criterion
\end{itemize}


The general process is thus not blocked when not all scored criteria are available.


Once all criteria scored, the score of of the two fists levels are calculated by weighed average of scores of the direcly inferior level.

\subsection{O3S tool}
The O3S tool allows to enter raw data and to evaluate software on the three majors axis, 
as well as to generete the identidy cards of evaluated software.


The granularity of evaluation is managed as follows: as long as all
criteria composing a sub category are not scored, its score is not 
calculated but entered by the user. As soon as all criteria are scored, 
its score is then automatically calculated.
